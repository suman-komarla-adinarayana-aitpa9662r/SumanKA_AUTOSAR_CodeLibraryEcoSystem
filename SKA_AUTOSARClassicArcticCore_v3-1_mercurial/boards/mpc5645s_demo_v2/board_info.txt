		In order for the MCAL ADC test to work. Three channels must be connected correctly. One to ground, one to +5V and one to a voltage divider.
		PC10(PCR40) is configured for ANS[10] and should be connected to voltage divider.
		PC11(PCR41) is configured for ANS[11] and should be connected to +5V.
		PC12(PCR42) is configured for ANS[12] and should be connected to GND.
		
		The connections should be made at the P5 and P6 connectors on the card:

  PWM    
    PK[7] -> PK[9] ? We have to skip DIP swtiches....
    or use 
    PA[0] and PA[1] , eMIOS18 and eMIOS17

  ICU
    J32[1] to J32[9]
    J32[3] to J32[11]
