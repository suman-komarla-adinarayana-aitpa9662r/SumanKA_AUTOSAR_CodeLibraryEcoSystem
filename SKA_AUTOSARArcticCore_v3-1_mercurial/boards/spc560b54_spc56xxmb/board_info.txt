 PJ1 Connector will have the following layout 
 (With ArcCore internal harness and SO/SI as seen from memory):

                 PJ7 
               1-X  X-2
               3-X  X-4 
               5-X  X-6

     SO/Brown 13-X  X-14 SI/Orange
     SCK/Blue 15-X  X-16  
              17-X  X-18    
       
CS/Green should be connected to PB12 (CS1_0 according to ref. manual). This is on PJ5.13.
Connect Vcc (red) to 3.3V.
Connect GND (black) to PJ2-17.


For MCAL DIO test:
On J8 (LED_EN) connect pin 5 and 7
