JTAG setup and isystem debugger:
 - There is a chapter on Xilinx Zynq in the online isystem manual under "OCD Cortex A R"
 - HW: 
   - Use the J58 JTAG header
   - Set JTAG_SEL_1 and JTAG_SEL_2 to "ON"
   - Set SW16 should all be set to "0" (ie switch "down" towards the text on the switch), except 3 and 4.
   - isystem->emulation options->JTAG
     - De-select "This is the single..... " 
     - Set IR Prefix: 6 and DR Prefix: 1
     
     
A9 - 
  - L1 Cache: 32K instruction and 32K data cache
  
  From: 7000-RM 
    Note: You must invalidate the instruction cache, the data cache, and BTAC before using them. It is 
    not required to invalidate the main TLB, even though it is recommended for safety reasons. This 
    ensures compatibility with future revisions of the processor.
  	
  - L2 Cache: 
     See 3.4.10 Programming Model in 7000-RM

ICU test setup:
	Connect PMOD_2_0 (J62.1) to PMOD_2_1 (J62.2)    
    (Requires that PL is programmed to connect these pins to EMIOGPIO[0:1].)   
    
    
ADC test setup:
	A voltage divider using one 10kOhm and one 5kOhm resistor is connected between XADC_VREF (Pin 11 On 
	the J40 header) and XADS_AGND (Pin 4,5 or 10 on the J40 header). 10kOhm towards VREF and 5kOhm 
	towards GND gives 5/(10+5)*VREF = 1/3*VREF between the resistors. This voltage is connected to VP 
	(Pin 2 on the J40 header). VREF is 1.25V so the measured voltage is 0.42V. This translates to a value
	of 1700 in the ADC.   

Dio test setup:
	These GPIOs have been configured for the Dio tests:
	Pin			Port pin/ Dio channel id		Pin out 
	EMIO4		58								J1.36
	EMIO5		59								J1.38
	EMIO6		60								J1.40
	
	EMIO6 is configured wrong though and does not work.
	
	EMIO4 and EMIO5 work. A cable should connect EMIO4 and EMIO5. 
	In the Port config, EMIO4 should be an output and EMIO5 an input.

Pwm test setup:
	The Zynq does not support Pwm_GetOutputState so instead a GPIO is used to read the current state
	of the signal.
	
	The Programmable Logic is set up so that J20.9 is the Pwm output (TTC0, wave 1) and
	J20.10 is the GPIO input (EMIO2).
	
	J20 is located on the expansion card and a cable must connect J20.9 and J20.10. 
	
    Pwm output can also be found on the following pins:
    TTC0_0 - PMOD2.2
    TTC1_1 - PMOD2_3_LS
