      * MIBSPI1NCS[1] is F3 according to the datasheet but R1 on the Hercules
      development board.
      * MIBSPI1CLK does not need to be set up since it is not multiplexed.

ADC:

	The ADC MCAL tests expect certain values on three ADC channels.
	
	The Hercules TMS570 boards have a 3.3V pin that is used for this test.
	The expected Adc values according to the datasheet formula
	(see chapter 22.1.1.3, tms570lc4357 ref manual, spnu563) are (ADREFHI measured to 5V):
	3.3V => 675
	0V => 0 (-0.5)
	3.3V / 2 (voltage division) => 337
	If the 3.3V is not 3.3V but for example 3.26V as measured on the board used
	the expected Adc value is 667 instead of 675. Also a small error in the conversion is tolerated.
	Let's say 3.25V (result should then be 665) is the minimum expected 3.3V and we tolerate an
	error in the measurement of 3 then the tolerance is:
	(675 - 665) + 3 = 13 */
	
	Adc unit 1, channel 0: GND
	Adc unit 1, channel 1: 3.3V
	Adc unit 1, channel 2: 3.3V / 2

Pwm:
	The flank counter test has been added.
	It uses a GPIO to sample the PWM signal since the Pwm_GetOutputState API is not supported.
	A cable must connect the PWM output and the GPIO input.
