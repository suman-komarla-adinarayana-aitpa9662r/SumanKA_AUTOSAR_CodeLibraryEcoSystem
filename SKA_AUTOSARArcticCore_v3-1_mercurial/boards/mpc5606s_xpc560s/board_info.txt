== SPI == 

Adding a SPI EEPROM (ST M95256)

Below is an example for interfacing SPI pins for a EEPROM chip to MCU pins.

<- XPC560S ->#<---------------------- MCU --->
             #       PAD Func              
----------------------------------------------
/S,PJ5-14# PB[13]  29  3  PCS1_0    
Q,PJ5-8  # PB[7]   23  1  SIN_0    
C,PJ5-10 # PB[9]   25  1  SCK_0     
D,PJ5-9  # PB[8]   24  1  SOUT_0

    /W   - High
    /HOLD - High
    Rest of the pins are obvious
    Connected with 5V logic
 
== ADC ==

MPC5606S has only one ADC.
In order for the MCAL ADC test to work on XPC56XX EVB motherboard Rev.C. Three channels must be connected correctly. One to ground, one to +5V and one to a voltage divider.
PC0(PCR30) is configured for ADC0_P[0] and should be connected to ground. (PJ4.1 to Ground)
PC1(PCR31) is configured for ADC0_P[1] and should be connected to +5V (PJ4.2 to +5V) 
PC2(PCR32) is configured for ADC0_P[2] and should be connected to a voltage divider(PJ4.3 to J40 - lower pin;No need to short jumpers J40).

 ---------------------------------- NOTE ----------------------------------
  The xPC560S EVB v1.0.1 manual is total crap in chapter "3.8 Pin Mapping"
  Known errors:
   PJ1
     PCS0.2, should be PCS1_0     
   PJ9-Port F
     As I understand it should map to Port F. However, PCS1_1 is
     located on PCR[78]=PF[8] on CPU is connected to PF[0] on PJ9!!
