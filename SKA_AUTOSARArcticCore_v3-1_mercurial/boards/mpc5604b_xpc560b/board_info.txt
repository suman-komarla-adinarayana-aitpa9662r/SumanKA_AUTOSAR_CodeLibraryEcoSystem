Info:	
  MPC5604B
  CPU:		 e200z0h (VLE only)
  Freq:		 64 Mhz
  Flash: 	 512KB, primary
             64K, data flash
  RAM:       48K, ECC
  
Memory Map:
 0x0000_0000 -> 0x0007_ffff   Flash
 0x0080_0000 -> 0x0080_ffff   Data Flash
 0x4000_0000 -> 0x4000_bfff   SRAM
 
NOTE! In Mcu.c only board specific clocks and pin muxing are setup and there is no config tool support. 
So, in order to use for instance FlexCan 3 you need to iniatilize FlexCan3 power control register i.e. ME.PCTL[19].R = 0x01;
in EcuM callout or modify an own version of Mcu.c. See Mcu_InitClock in Mcu.c for further info. 
 
CAN and LIN: In order to use CAN or LIN the MC33905 circuit need to be initialized accordingly using DSPI. 
             Contact Freescale support for source code.
== ADC ==
NOTE! It ADC1 is used, this must be powered by connecting AVDDSUPPLY to PD12 (PJ3.13) and 
AVSSSUPPLY to PB11 (PJ5.12)

== SPI == 

Adding a SPI EEPROM (Microship 25LC160B)

To the left are the pins as they are names in XPC56xxMBSCH (schema for the main board, page 11 of 12)

    Rest of the pins are obvious
 
    Connected with 5V logic

---------------------------------- NOTE ----------------------------------
  The xPC560S EVB v1.0.1 manual is total crap in chapter "3.8 Pin Mapping"
  Known errors:
   PJ1
     PCS0.2, should be PCS1_0     
   PJ9-Port F
     As I understand it should map to Port F. However, PCS1_1 is
     located on PCR[78]=PF[8] on CPU is connected to PF[0] on PJ9!!
