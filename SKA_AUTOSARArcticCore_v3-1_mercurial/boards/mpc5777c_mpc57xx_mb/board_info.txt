EQADC

Potentiometer (RV1) will be operated by connecting J53 (on EVB) and adjustable (0-5V), and connect the jumper J54 between 3 and 4 to get 3.3V linear 
regulator output in the 57xx mother board.

ETHERNET SIMPLE TEST:
jumper connections for RMII mode
On Daughter card MPC5777C-416DS connect following pins
J524 : 1-2 is correct. (wrong information in MPC5777C EVB User Guide Rev 0)
J510 : 2-3 
J24  : 1-2
J25  : 1-2

On Motherboard MPC57XX
j61 : 2-3
j64 : open
J63 : 1K Ohm resistor between pin 2-3


Pwm:
	The flank counter test has been added.
	A cable must connect PWM output to  GPIO input.
	*Set EMIOS1 pin as DIO and configure it as SIUA input port in Port configuration .
	
	Setup:
		Function		Pin				       Ball
		PWM				EMIOS22			       PK5 (110 Pin)
		GPIO IN			EMIOS1(Set as DIO)	   PI0 (85 Pin)
